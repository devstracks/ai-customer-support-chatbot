## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

The AI Customer Support Platform implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

1. **Network Layer**: Firewalls, network segmentation, and TLS encryption
2. **Application Layer**: Input validation, output encoding, and secure coding practices
3. **Data Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit, access controls
4. **User Layer**: Authentication, authorization, and session management

### Threat Model

Key threats addressed by the security architecture:

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized access | Strong authentication, role-based access control |
| Data leakage | Encryption, access controls, data minimization |
| API abuse | Rate limiting, API keys, request validation |
| Injection attacks | Input sanitization, parameterized queries |
| Denial of service | Rate limiting, resource quotas, auto-scaling |
| Insider threats | Audit logging, principle of least privilege |

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

1. **JWT-based Authentication**
   - Used for admin dashboard and API access
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Secure token storage practices

2. **API Key Authentication**
   - Used for service-to-service communication
   - Key rotation policies
   - Scoped permissions per key

3. **WebSocket Authentication**
   - Token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Connection validation on establishment
   - Periodic re-authentication

### Authorization Model

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Predefined roles: Admin, Manager, Agent, Viewer
   - Fine-grained permissions for each role
   - Resource-level access controls

2. **Multi-tenancy Isolation**
   - Organization-level data isolation
   - Tenant context validation on all requests
   - Cross-tenant access prevention

### Session Management

1. **Secure Session Handling**
   - Server-side session validation
   - Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - Session timeout and idle timeout
   - Session termination on security events

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

| Category | Examples | Protection Level |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Public | Product information, FAQs | Basic |
| Internal | Conversation logs, analytics | Medium |
| Confidential | Customer PII, authentication data | High |
| Restricted | API keys, encryption keys | Maximum |

### Encryption

1. **Data in Transit**
   - TLS 1.3 for all external communications
   - TLS for service-to-service communication
   - Certificate management and rotation

2. **Data at Rest**

   - File system encryption for media storage
   - Encryption key management

3. **End-to-End Encryption (Future)**
   - Optional E2EE for sensitive customer communications
   - Key management infrastructure

### Data Minimization and Retention

1. **Data Collection Principles**
   - Collect only necessary data
   - Clear purpose specification
   - Consent management

2. **Retention Policies**
   - Conversation logs: 90 days by default
   - User data: Duration of account plus 30 days
   - Analytics data: Anonymized after 12 months

3. **Data Deletion**
   - Secure deletion procedures
   - Verification of deletion
   - Backup purging

## API Security

### API Protection Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - Schema validation for all requests
   - Type checking and sanitization
   - Rejection of malformed requests

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Per-endpoint rate limits
   - Per-user and per-IP rate limits
   - Graduated response (warning, temporary block, permanent block)

3. **Request Authentication**
   - Authentication required for all non-public endpoints
   - Signature verification for sensitive operations
   - Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks

### WebSocket Security

1. **Connection Security**
   - Authentication required for connection establishment
   - Message validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting for message sending

2. **Message Integrity**
   - Message format validation
   - Prevention of unauthorized message types
   - Secure handling of binary data

## Infrastructure Security
